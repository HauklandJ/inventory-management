# Inventory Management System

I made this simple and user-friendly IMS for my at the time workplace to be used for tracking the items they received at their warehouse. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software

```
All that is needed for development is python version 3.x.
I would recommend using Python 3.3-3.6 if you want to use pyinstaller to make a stand-alone executable
```

### Installing

Simply pull the .py file using git

```
Under the repository name, click Clone or download.
In the Clone with HTTPs section, click to copy the clone URL for the repository.
Open
Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made
```

## Built With
